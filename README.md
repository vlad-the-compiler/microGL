# Is this still coming out?

Yes. Development, however, stalled some time ago due to this being just a hobby project and due to having encountered an issue with the current format of the codebase, where the target of "pretty AND fast" couldn't be achieved. Turns out highly optimized runtime performance and eye candy are hard to achieve at once - who would've thought.
This is the third major refactor of the library, and the final one. Stay tuned for updates!
